            <p>

              southern Caribbean Sea that forms a constituent country of the

            </p>

            <p>
              Cura√ßao harbors one of the most multifaceted cultures in the
              Caribbean, thanks to its long, varied history and its close
              proximity to South America. Originally settled by the Arawaks
              nearly 6000 years ago, the island came under Spanish rule in the
              early 16th century, but it was abandoned because of its perceived
              lack of riches. The Dutch West India Company picked up where the
              Spanish left off, and Cura√ßao became a major hub for the slave
              trade.

            <h3>Why is Cura√ßao such a colourful place?</h3>
            <p>
              According to Legend history, the island in the early 1800's was
              made colourful through it variety of building colors as a result
              of the Governors constant migraines. It was assumed that these
              migraines were as a result of the bright reflections on the white
              buildings. As a result he ordered all buildings could be painted
              any colour apart from white. Today, when you go to Willemstad you
              will see various buildings with different colours.
